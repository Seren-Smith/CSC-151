I created a shared drive for the Julia project on approximately April 14th, where we could share any resources that we found surrounding Julia (and where we could collaborate on a poster as needed). 

I spent around April 14th-April 23rd studying Julia through a variety of LinkedIn guides/tutorials, as well as some YouTube tutorials. This was my way of familiarizing myself with the language and its features. 

Then, following the preliminary "learning" files, I decided to work on two programs: a caesar.jl program as well as a pokerhand.jl program. The caesar went by rather quickly, as it was merely the "caesar" rather than the one-time pad attempt.

Rather than do one-time-pad, I decided for my other exploration program to do pokerhand.jl. Back in a high school course I took, I did a program similar to this, but in Java, so I took this project as an opportunity to rewrite that code, but in Julia, as to still have a well-thought reference without doing the same thing (i.e. One Time Pad) yet again. 

Julia is definitely a new favorite of mine; I'll be looking into the 30 Days of Julia sometime during the summer, and I look forward to working with it as I explore computer programming and machine learning.
